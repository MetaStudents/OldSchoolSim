- implement something equivalent to java.util.TreeSet or C++'s std::set so we can have all the homeworks, lectures, etc guaranteed unique and in order (haxe standard library is missing this)
- create lecture schedule generators
- generate exams and homeworks in real time, more loosely coupled with the lectures
- *GRAPHICS*
- make use of the new and unfinished Course class
